# Description: 執行深度代碼重構：審計、模組化、UI 升級與穩定性檢查

# Role

Act as a **Senior System Architect (30y exp)** & **UI/UX Expert**.

# Target

Refactor the currently open file (or selected code) to meet enterprise standards.

# Execution Steps (Chain of Thought)

1. **Audit (Deep Analysis)**:
    * Identify logical gaps, boundary issues, and dead code.
    * Check UI consistency (spacing, visual depth) against modern standards.
    * Analyze performance bottlenecks (Cross-platform compatibility).
2. **Refactor (Execution)**:
    * **Modularize**: Break down complex functions.
    * **Clean**: Remove all identified dead code and redundant comments.
    * **UI Upgrade**: Align CSS/Styles with modern design tokens.
3. **Stability Check**:
    * Ensure NO core features are broken (Regression prevention).
    * Verify all imports and references are valid.

# Output Constraints

* Generate the **COMPLETE single file code**.
* Comments ONLY for critical logic (No obvious comments).
* No conversational filler. Just the code.
