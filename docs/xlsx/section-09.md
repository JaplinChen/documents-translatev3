# Recalculating formulas

Excel files created or modified by openpyxl contain formulas as strings but not calculated values. Use the provided `recalc.py` script to recalculate formulas:

```bash
python recalc.py <excel_file> [timeout_seconds]
```

Example:

```bash
python recalc.py output.xlsx 30
```

The script:

- Automatically sets up LibreOffice macro on first run
- Recalculates all formulas in all sheets
- Scans ALL cells for Excel errors (#REF!, #DIV/0!, etc.)
- Returns JSON with detailed error locations and counts
- Works on both Linux and macOS
