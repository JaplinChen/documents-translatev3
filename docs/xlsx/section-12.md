# Code Style Guidelines

**IMPORTANT**: When generating Python code for Excel operations:

- Write minimal, concise Python code without unnecessary comments
- Avoid verbose variable names and redundant operations
- Avoid unnecessary print statements

**For Excel files themselves**:

- Add comments to cells with complex formulas or important assumptions
- Document data sources for hardcoded values
- Include notes for key calculations and model sections
